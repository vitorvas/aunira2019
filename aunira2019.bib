abstract = "The Colorado School of Mines installed a neutron radiography system at the United States Geological Survey TRIGA reactor in 2012. An upgraded beamline could dramatically improve the imaging capabilities of this system. This project performed computational analyses to support the design of a new beamline, with the major goals of minimizing beam divergence and maximizing beam intensity. The new beamline will consist of a square aluminum tube with an 11.43cm (4.5 in) inner side length and 0.635cm (0.25 in) thick walls. It is the same length as the original beam tube (8.53 m) and is composed of 1.22 m (4 ft) and 1.52 m (5ft) flanged sections which bolt together. The bottom 1.22 m of the beamline is a cylindrical aluminum pre-collimator which is 0.635cm (0.25 in) thick, with an inner diameter of 5.08cm (2 in). Based on Monte Carlo model results, when a pre-collimator is present, the use of a neutron absorbing liner on the inside surface of the beam tube has almost no effect on the angular distribution of the neutron current at the collimator exit. The use of a pre-collimator may result in a non-uniform flux profile at the image plane; however, as long as the collimator is at least three times longer than the pre-collimator, the flux distortion is acceptably low."

abstract = "A simple digital neutron radiography device consisting of an off-the-shelf Canon camera and a scintillation screen in a single-mirror refection configuration was tested at The Ohio State University Research Reactor. The device is capable of 5.8 (lp/mm) spatial resolution at 10% modulation transfer function (MTF), corresponding to 86μm. Although this resolution is not on a par with a cooled CCD based system, it does provide a low-cost alternative with an adequate resolution and simplicity for applications where such ability is needed but resources are limited. The performance of the neutron imaging apparatus was quantified with the MTF, noise power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). While the perceptual contrast increases with neutron fluence, the MTF remains roughly constant and the total DQE levels off when a threshold fluence is reached."
